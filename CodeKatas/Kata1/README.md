This is a CodeKata that I designed myself to solve a date manipulation problem
If you have a random date of the year, how do you find the beginning of the 
quarter, month, or week that the randomly selected date is within?

Steps to solving:
1. Write basic index.html to hold everything
2. Figure out how to run EC6
3. Figure out how to run Babel
4. Setup Q-Unit test environment
5. Install moment.js with npm
6. Write Q-Unit test to pass
7. Come up with 2-3 solutions to the problem
